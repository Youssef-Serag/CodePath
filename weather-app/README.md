# Project 5: Data Dashboard Part 1

## Description

Data can tell interesting stories. In this two-part project, you will create a data dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API. In part one, you choose a public API and construct the dashboard view of the project. The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered. The dashboard should tell an interesting story about the data and spark the userâ€™s curiosity, inviting them to learn more.
